# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The user management interface currently has an edit button for each user that should open a modal dialog for editing user information. However, the modal is not functioning because the JavaScript event handlers for the user edit functionality are missing from the admin.js file. This feature needs to implement the modal functionality to allow administrators to edit user details inline without navigating to a separate page.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to click the edit button next to a user to open a modal dialog with the user's current information pre-populated, so that I can quickly edit user details without leaving the current page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator clicks the edit button (with class "edit-user-btn") THEN the system SHALL open a modal dialog containing the user edit form
2. WHEN the modal opens THEN the system SHALL pre-populate all form fields with the current user's data (name, email, bio, role)
3. WHEN the modal opens THEN the system SHALL set the form action URL to the correct user update endpoint
4. WHEN the modal is displayed THEN the system SHALL show "Edit User" as the modal title

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to close the edit modal using the close button or cancel button, so that I can dismiss the modal without making changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator clicks the "Ã—" close button THEN the system SHALL close the modal dialog
2. WHEN an administrator clicks the "Cancel" button THEN the system SHALL close the modal dialog
3. WHEN the modal is closed THEN the system SHALL reset the modal visibility state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the edit modal to handle form submission properly, so that user updates are processed correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the edit form is submitted THEN the system SHALL send a PUT/PATCH request to the correct user update endpoint
2. WHEN form validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL display the errors within the modal
3. WHEN the update is successful THEN the system SHALL close the modal and refresh the user list or show success feedback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the user edit modal to follow the same design patterns as other modals in the admin interface, so that the user experience is consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modal is displayed THEN the system SHALL use the same styling and behavior as existing modals (services, skills, education, experience)
2. WHEN the modal opens THEN the system SHALL use the same show/hide mechanism as other modals in the admin interface
3. WHEN multiple modals exist on the page THEN the system SHALL ensure only one modal can be open at a time
